# water-quality-monitoring
The Water Quality Monitoring Project tracks important parameters like PH, TDS, and turbidity to check if water is safe for use. Data is taken from government sources or sample inputs, cleaned using scripts, and shown on a dashboard with graphs and heat maps. The system compares values with WHO and national stadards to mark areas as safe or unsafe.
